# Azure MLOps

This repo will provide insights on the DevOps workflow for Machine Learning.  This will content will help partenrs deliver art of the possible conversations with their customers.  Additionally, we will have training content that can be leveraged for MLOps-in-a-Day sessions.  This site is an aggregator of content and will help our partners go to one location to find all the relevant and up-to-date content.

### Overview of MLOps (Azure ML Services + DevOps)
Machine Learning has typically been an ad-hoc process where business executives request analysis and data scientists conduct it.  These processes are quite brittle and create large scale technical debt.  Data scientists typically ran their workshops as independent contractors who didn't need to collaborate or scale.  The motto it works on my computer was sufficient since these experiments where for ad-hoc research and not end-user applications.

In today's world, we need to build out mission critical applications that contain machine learning and artificial intelligence models.  These applications drive the wider adoption of ML & AI that requires enterprises to build out a DevOps practice (COE) as it relates to Machine Learning.  The key drivers are;

  1. Multiple Data Scientists working on one or more models
  2. Application Developers need to reuse ML models for applications
  3. Reproducibility of their models
  4. Monitoring and Deployment of their models
  5. Agile releases to minimize bugs and impact on end-users


Without the DevOps practices for Machine Learning, customers can be negatively impacted by these models and tarnish a company's brand image.
